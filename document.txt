### Checkout Workflow

**Scenario:**
1. Authenticated user has cart with:
   - Product A ($10, qty 2)
   - Product B ($5, qty 1)
2. Product A price updated to $12 before checkout
3. User proceeds to checkout

**Expected Behavior:**
- Order is created with status `pending`
- Order items snapshot prices:
  - Product A → $10
  - Product B → $5
- Total amount = $25
- Cart is cleared after successful checkout

**Result:** ✅ Passed






### Cart Merge (Guest → Authenticated User)

**Scenario:**
1. Guest user adds Product A (qty 2) and Product B (qty 1) to cart
2. User logs in
3. System detects existing authenticated cart with:
   - Product A (qty 3)
   - Product C (qty 1)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Product A quantity becomes 5
- Product B is moved to authenticated cart
- Product C remains unchanged
- Guest cart is deleted
- No duplicate cart items are created

**Edge Cases Tested:**
- Guest cart empty
- Authenticated cart empty
- Both carts contain same product
- Quantity overflow prevention

**Result:** ✅ Passed
